# Task: write the XColos game file for "Assurance Threshold - Three Hunters"

Write the game below as one complete game definition for the XColos engine. Reply with ONE JSON object and nothing else.

## The game

Players: 3 to 3.

Setup: 3 players play 10 rounds. At start each player is privately dealt a type: Sheltered or Exposed, each 50% independent. Type is seen only by that player and never revealed. Each round simultaneously every player chooses C (hunt stag / invest) or D (hunt hare / don't invest). Let n_C be number of players (0-3) who chose C this round. Payoffs this round: If you chose C: you get 5 if n_C==3, otherwise you get 1 if your type is Sheltered and 0 if Exposed. If you chose D: you get 4 if n_C==2 (you are the lone defector), otherwise you get 2. Note this satisfies 5>4>=2>1 and 5>4>=2>0. After the round each player is told n_C and their own payoff, but not who chose what. Types are not revealed. Totals accumulate over rounds. The game ends after 10 rounds.

How the winner is decided: Target winner: after 10 rounds every player whose cumulative total is >=38 wins. If one player reaches target and others do not, that player is the sole winner. If multiple reach target they draw among themselves (shared win). If none reaches target the game is a draw. Higher total alone does not win unless it reaches 38.

## The interface the file must use

Independent tests were written against these names and you cannot see them, so use them exactly.

- each player: `total_score` (number, visible: public, starts 0): cumulative payoff over all rounds
- the table: `round_number` (number, visible: public, starts 0): number of rounds completed
- the table: `n_c` (number, visible: public, starts 0): number of players who chose C this round, revealed to all
- parameters (each must be an attribute holding this value, never a number buried in a step): rounds = 10, payoff_c_all_cooperate = 5, payoff_c_sheltered_partial = 1, payoff_c_exposed_partial = 0, payoff_d_lone_defector = 4, payoff_d_other = 2, win_threshold = 38, type_probability_sheltered = 0.5
- the game ends with exactly one of these results, named exactly: `seat 1`, `seat 2`, `seat 3`, `shared win`, `draw`
- anything else the game needs to keep track of is yours to design: name it as you like.

## How the platform works

The complete file format reference and two example games are in your system prompt. Follow them exactly: every key an
action accepts is listed there, and the loader refuses any other. The outcome must be decided by arithmetic: every
ending's `when` is a calc condition, no prose conditions; no step uses `llm` and every step uses `text`; choices made at the same
moment are a `poll`. The end screen must say more than who won: every ending's `text` gives the final scores or deciding figures with
placeholders such as `{players[0].score}`, and every ending also has an `llm` asking for a short summary of how the game went and why
this result (`text` is the complete fallback; the `result` is still decided by the calc). End with a `result` and a calc condition as the `rps` example does (not the `auction`'s `winner`).

- Mistakes the loader has refused before, so avoid them:
  * A PLAYER attribute's `visible` is one of public, ally or others, never `none`. (`none` is only for table
    attributes.) For something only its owner should see, use `ally`.
  * A `poll` step has no `each` key, and no key the format reference does not list for `poll`. `each` belongs to `ask`.
  * Do not write a `deal` block unless it has the `into` it requires. Set starting values with `initial` on
    attributes, or with `set` operations in `setup`, instead.
  * Every key must be one the reference lists for that action; a misspelled or invented key is refused.
  * An answer to an `ask` or a `poll` exists ONLY if the step binds it with `verify: {"bind": "name"}`; a later `update`
    stores it with `"value": "$name"` (see the `rps` example, `card1`). A step that asks and binds nothing throws the
    answers away, and every score that depends on them stays at its starting value.
  * An attribute declared `"mutable": false` is set once, by an `initialize` step, and any other step that sets it crashes the game
    ("declared static and has already been dealt"). To set a hidden type or a starting value at setup, either use an `initialize`
    step or leave the attribute mutable.
  * Do not write steps that do nothing (for example an `if` of `{"calc": "False"}`), or two polls where one will do.
  * Reply with one complete JSON object: double-quoted keys and strings, no comments, no trailing commas. WRITE IT INDENTED,
    two spaces per level and one key per line, so you can see the nesting and count the brackets; do not put it on one line.
- Keep a round to at most 12 steps. Put several operations in one `update`'s `do` list, and use one `tell` for the
  reveal. A game with more steps than that is rejected as too large, however well it plays.

## A pattern that works (this complete game is tested: it loads, ends, and every attribute it declares is updated)

For "each player chooses in private, then the choices decide the score":
1. One `ask` per seat, addressed with `{"where": "you.seat == N"}`, with `"verify": {"bind": "aN"}`. The answer exists only because it is bound.
2. One `update` after both. It `set`s the bound answers into table attributes with `"$aN"`, and `adjust`s each player's score with a
   `calc` that may use `$aN` and `if ... else`.
3. A `check` with `when` and `against`, and the endings in `end`, comparing `players[0].score` and `players[1].score`.
Every attribute is set by a step that runs. Adapt this; do not invent another way to store answers.

Your file is checked by the platform's loader, a rule that the outcome is arithmetic, random play, a check that every
attribute is actually updated, and tests written independently from the rules. If it is refused you will be told why and
shown your file again; fix what is wrong and keep the rest.
